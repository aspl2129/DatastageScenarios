# Step-by-Step Logic
### Step 1: Read the Source File (emp.txt)
- The input file (emp.txt) contains only employee records without a header or trailer.
- Example content:
  
  John Doe
  Jane Smith
  David Lee
  Emily Brown
  Michael Clark
  Sarah Jones
  James Wilson
  Christopher Young
  Daniel White
  

---

### Step 2: Use a Transformer Stage
- Create three Stage Variables to handle header, counter, and trailer.
- Use Two Output Links:
  - Output Link 1 → Writes Header + Data
  - Output Link 2 → Writes Trailer

#### Define Stage Variables

Stage Variable: svCounter
Data Type: Integer
Initial Value: 0
Derivation: svCounter + 1

Stage Variable: svHeader
Data Type: Varchar(100)
Initial Value: ""
Derivation: IF @INROWNUM = 1 THEN 'HEADER|' : CurrentTimestamp() ELSE ''

Stage Variable: svTrailer
Data Type: Varchar(100)
Initial Value: ""
Derivation: 'TRAILER|' : svCounter

Stage Variable: svFirstrow
Data Type: Varchar(100)
Initial Value: ""
Derivation: IF @INROWNUM = 1 THEN LnkEmp.EmployeeName ELSE ''

---

### Step 3: Configure Output Link 1 (Header + Data)
#### Constraint:
@INROWNUM = 1 OR NOT ISNULL(LnkEmp.EmployeeName)

#### Derivation:
IF @INROWNUM = 1 THEN svHeader : CHAR(10) : LnkEmp.EmployeeName 
ELSE LnkEmp.EmployeeName

-Ensures header is written first.  
-Ensures all employee records are included.

---

### Step 4: Configure Output Link 2 (Trailer)
#### Constraint:
LastRow()

✔ Ensures the trailer is only written once at the end.

#### Derivation:
svTrailer

✔ Ensures the trailer contains the correct count.  

---

### Step 5: Write to Target File (emp_output.txt)
- Output Link 1 writes to the main target file (emp_output.txt).
- Output Link 2 appends the trailer to the same file.

---

### Expected Final Output (emp_output.txt)

HEADER|2025-02-25 09:30:32
John Doe
Jane Smith
David Lee
Emily Brown
Michael Clark
Sarah Jones
James Wilson
Christopher Young
Daniel White
TRAILER|9

# Why This Approach Works
✔ Ensures Header is written at the top.  
✔ All employee records are included.  
✔ Trailer is written only once at the bottom with the correct count.  
✔ Simple, efficient, and does not require extra processing stages.
